This application is attempting to be the 'simplest thing that will work' in demonstrating Htmx using a Web App with Razor pages.

Starting with the community editon of Visual Studio 2022, the base project template is 'ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)'

Special Thanks to the following for getting me into the Htmx universe:
