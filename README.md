This application is attempting to be the 'simplest thing that will work' in demonstrating Htmx using a Web App with Razor pages.

Starting with the community editon of Visual Studio 2022, the base project template is 'ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)'

<p>Three Navigation Links have been added to the base project: Hello World, Htmx Tests and About</p>

<p><b>Hello World</b> makes a simple hx-get change swapping Hi for Hello World</p>

<p><b>Htmx Tests</b> demonstrates hx-get and hx-post requests including using 'hx-vals' and 'form' to send data in the post body</p>

<p><b>About</b> contains this page</p>
